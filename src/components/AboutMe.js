      <p>
        I'm Dannika, but you can call me Danni. I'm a software developer based in Irvine, CA. They say I'm an artist gone rogue, 
        always finding new ways to express my digital creativity. If there's an area in frontend development I haven't explored, 
        I'll be sure to find it!
