      <p>
        I'm <b>Dannika</b>, but you can call me <b>Danni</b>. I'm a software developer based in <b>Irvine, CA</b>. They say I'm an artist gone rogue, 
        always finding new ways to express my digital creativity. If there's an area in frontend development I haven't explored, 
        I'll be sure to find it!
